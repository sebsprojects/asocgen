I want to re-discover groups of finite order. For that I need to find
associative structures. So here I am searching for them in haskell.

# Questions
* Are there configurations of incomplete tables which are incomplete associative
  but will never lead to a complete associative table?
* Schemes where we try to keep to number of allowed symbols to a minimum, ie.
  not just increasing with UP but picking from a minimal list of symbols to
  help associativity detection.

# TODO
* Make sure tail set really works as intended
* Optimize low-hanging fruits: selectCol atal

* Multithreading
