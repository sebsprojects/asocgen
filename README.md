# Asocgen
I want to re-discover groups of finite order. For that I need to find
associative structures. So here I am searching for them in *not haskell* (well
turns out C is better for this job).

# Questions
* Are there configurations of incomplete tables which are incomplete
  associative but will never lead to a complete associative table?
* Schemes where we try to keep to number of allowed symbols to a minimum, ie.
  not just increasing with UP but picking from a minimal list of symbols to
  help associativity detection.

# TODO
* Multithreading
